### 13. Roman to Integer 
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.


### 234. Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.


### 383. Ransom Note

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.
Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.


### 412. Fizz Buzz

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

    answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
    answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
    answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
    answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.


### 876. Middle of the Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

### 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.
A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
    The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
    Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.
Return the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.
